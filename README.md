# carmite-discord-bot
A multi-purpose bot, primarily focused around interacting with APIs and online media such as League of Legends, Cartoons/Animation, Korean Pop Music, and other varying content.

# Notice:
This repo contains placeholder API keys for both Discord and Riot Games functionality, to run this bot locally both keys will need to be updated (they are also accessed from their individual commands as per my personal testing needs).
